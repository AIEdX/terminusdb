***

TerminusDB is a distributed database with a collaboration model. It is designed to be like git, but for data. If you are reading this, **give this repo a star**. 

The building blocks of the model are:

  - Revision Control: commits for every update
  - Diff: differences between commits can be interpreted as patches between states
  - Push/Pull/Clone: communicate diffs between nodes using push / pull / clone


TerminusDB allows you to link JSON documents in a knowledge graph through a [document API](https://terminusdb.com/docs/v10.0/#/reference/reference-document-interface). TerminusDB is available as a standalone server, or you can [use online](https://dashboard.terminusdb.com/).

WOQL is a powerful query language which allows you to concisely express complex patterns over arbitrary data structures. What makes it so expressive and easy to use is the [radical simplicity of the core underlying concepts](https://terminusdb.com/blog/the-power-of-web-object-query-language/).


## Installation Guide

Install as a [Docker Container](https://terminusdb.com/docs/index/terminusdb/install/install-as-docker-container). This uses [TerminusDB Bootstrap](https://github.com/terminusdb/terminusdb-bootstrap).

Install from [Source Code](https://terminusdb.com/docs/index/terminusdb/install/install-from-source-code).

Install the [Python Client](https://pypi.org/project/terminusdb-client/) üêç.

Install the [JavaScript Client](https://github.com/terminusdb/terminusdb-client) üåê.

## TerminusDB CLI

The simplest way to see how the TerminusDB CLI can be used is to clone
a resource from [TerminusX](https://dashboard.terminusdb.com/). This is analogous to creating a repository on GitHub.

Log into TerminusX, create a new data product, and make sure
you have an access token to the team in which we created that data
product. Then copy the URL to clone from the data product info page.

If you make a data product called `example` in the team
`Terminators`. We could then issue the following command using the
TerminusDB CLI.

```shell
./terminusdb clone 'https://cloud-dev.terminusdb.com/Terminators/example' --token='XYZ'
```

Once completed, you'll have a local copy of this database.
