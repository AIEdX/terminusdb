## Start with console

The TerminusDB Console is a ReactJS application that provides users with an interface for managing and querying TerminusDB. Assuming TerminusDB is installed successfully (Refer https://terminusdb.github.io/terminusdb/#/Intro_Tutorials/Getting_Started), we can carry on with how to get started with Console.

The landing page of console will be as shown below, with a list of database already created. A freshly installed console with
no database should directly lead you to creating a database work flow for you to get started.
